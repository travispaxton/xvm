/**
 * A database connection.
 *
 * This interface is designed as the root injectable representation of an object database. Database
 * engines have dramatically differing designs and implementations, so an attempt to represent that
 * scope of variability in an interface would be challenging to say the least. Instead, to simplify
 * the actual usage of a database, one can imagine all of that work of starting and connecting to a
 * database (which may differ substantially in method and approach from one database engine to
 * another) will have already need to have been completed by the time that an application is able
 * to access that database, which is the point represented by this interface.
 *
 * A connection represents the union of the contents of the database (the "root of the schema") with
 * the potential for a transaction. This allows a database to be used in an "auto-commit" style,
 * which means either without transactionality, or with each mutating operation automatically
 * creating and committing a transaction around the mutation. Alternatively, the connection can be
 * used to create a transaction (up to one transaction at a time, without transaction nesting);
 * similar to the connection, the transaction represents the union of the contents of the database
 * (the "root of the schema") with the ability to commit or roll back the transaction.
